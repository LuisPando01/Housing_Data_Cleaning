# Housing Data Cleaning

This project shows how to clean data in SQL with the example of a Housing Data from Nashville, USA.

The order in which the data is cleaned is the following:

  - Review and change the date format
  - Fill blank values
  - Divide texts like address
  - Standardise the texts
  - Remove duplicates
  - Delete unused columns
